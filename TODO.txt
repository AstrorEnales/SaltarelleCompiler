TODO:
v1:
Understand why R# doesn't get the define symbols right.
Convert between JsDictionary and Dictionary

v2:
yield
async
goto
Query comprehension
Other reference importers.
Improve exception mapping (eg. TypeError => InvalidCastException, etc).
operator true + operator false.
Don't assign a field the default value when it is always assigned before being read in the constructor.
Multi-dimensional arrays
Ensure that type initializers are run in the correct order.
Use the entire location instead of just the start location in error messages.
NAnt task
Change the INamingConventionResolver interface (should not contain methods for variable names, should be one resolver per referenced assembly).
Allow a class to inherit from two types with a member with the same name IFF both the members are implemented by the same method.
Some kind of attribute to put on delegates to indicate that they will be called with the wrong 'this', thus forcing a capture to a local variable on method group conversion. Should not be able to convert from delegate without this option to delegate with it.

v3:
Source mapping
Formatting options
Expression trees
Clip smaller integer types to their range
Checked/unchecked

-----

Script# features to handle:
ScriptQualifierAttribute.
ScriptAssemblyAttribute.
QUnit tests


Runtime library:

ObservableCollection: Inherit IList<T>, ensure works.
Queue, Queue<T>: Ensure works
Stack, Stack<T>: Ensure works
Function: Should be convertible to Delegate.
