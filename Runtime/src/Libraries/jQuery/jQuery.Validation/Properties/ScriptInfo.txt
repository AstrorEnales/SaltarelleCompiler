jQuery Validation Plugin
===============================================================================

This assembly provides access to jQuery Validation plugin APIs. This is only meant for
use at development time, so you can reference and compile your c# code against
the plugin APIs. You must include the appropriate plugin scripts in your page for
runtime functionality.

More information is on http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation and
